# deckboard-ohm-ram
Display hardware status from Open Hardware Monitor on Deckboard button

## NOW WITH RAM !!
This extension is made by Riva Farabi, not me. All credits go to him.

I just updated it a bit to add the display of RAM usage


## Warning ! 
Make sure you uninstall the original version of this extension to avoid any bug/error on Deckboard.
By doing this, there is a chance that the button displaying OHM status will be deleted
