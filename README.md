Display hardware status from Open Hardware Monitor on Deckboard button

## NOW WITH RAM !!
This extension is made by Riva Farabi, not me. All credits go to him.

I just updated it a bit to add the display of RAM usage


## Install
1. Close Deckboard completely
2. Open this folder `C:\Users\%USERPROFILE%\deckboard\extensions`
3. Delete the file `open-hardware-monitor.asar`
4. Download [this extension](https://github.com/DataNext27/deckboard-ohm-ram/releases/tag/v1) (the .asar file)
5. Put it in the extensions folder
6. Start Deckboard and create a button


### Warning ! 
Make sure you uninstall the original version of this extension to prevent any bug/error on Deckboard.

By doing this, there is a chance that the button displaying OHM status will be deleted
